##Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Answer:
Vulnerabilities are grouped according to services as below
    IAM:
	Password is not complying with IAM password policy
    EC2:
        Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
        Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 3389
	VPC flow logging should be enabled in all VPCs
    CloudWatch
        Log metric filter and alarm exist for events changes
    CloudTrail 
	CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
##Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1)Disable password authentication in web server
2)Correct the securities group according to comments
3)Enable VPC flow log
4)Setup metric and alarm in CloudWatch
5)Enable CloudTrail
